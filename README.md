[Joint TC1-TC2 International Symposium on Photonics and Education in Measurement Science](https://www.imeko-jena.com) 
LaTex template for submission evaluation.

### Getting started

To download this project you can either click on the Download button and download a .zip file containing everything 
here (this is particularly useful for Windows users). This is a quick and easy solution. However, if you have git 
installed, you can open a terminal and type:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rafaelcelestre/Joint_IMEKO_TC1TC2_evaluation_form
```

There you go: you have downloaded the project.

### Editing the template if...

**a) I am a LaTex expert**

Congratulations! I am sure whatever you write looks pretty, but stop reading this and get back to work! Papers won't 
grade themselves. Seriously, now... there is no catch. The project will compile easily.

**b) I am a MS Word person**

Even if you are a MS Word person, if you are in science and research, you will not be able to avoid LaTex forever. You
can run from it, but you can't hide!

Let's divide the MS Word group into two:

* **You will never trick me into learning LaTex (#MSWordForever)**

Well, that is a narrow minded view. MSWord is not portable across from different operating systems and even
on the same OS, different versions behave differently. But you are a lost case, just follow the steps below:

- Create an account on [overleaf](www.overleaf.com);
- Upload the .zip file you downloaded from GitHub;
- Edit the .tex file;
- Compile and download the .pdf file.

Overleaf is a cloud service for writing documents on LaTex. It is much easier to use than LaTex on your 
PC.

The .tex file is easy to understand. It is commented where you folks have to insert your alterations.
And if you have any troubles or doubts, this is a [good way to get help](http://bfy.tw/MLH4).


* **I have always wanted to move away from proprietary software**

Firstly, that is a very positive attitude - congrats. Just know that you can follow the steps above, 
if you don't have much time now. Overleaf is LaTex, but more user friendly. However, if you wish to 
LaTex running on your machine, roll up your sleeves! That won't be easy at first, but once it is all working fine, you will 
see how rewarding it is to use LaTex. **[To be continued...]**
